This is a sample **Tower Defense** game project developed using **raylib Game Development Library** in just three weeks during a school term. We used **Object Oriented Paradigm** and **Singleton Design Pattern** with **C++**, designed our own textures and graphics using **Photoshop** and **Blender**.
